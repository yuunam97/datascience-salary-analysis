### Description: 
This analysis provides a holistic view of the data science salary landscape, covering various aspects such as experience levels, top jobs, types of employment, company sizes, and geographical distributions. Additional analyses offer insights into salary trends over different years, based on experience levels, company sizes, and geographical locations. Visualization was achieved using Plotly and Seaborn package to aid in better understanding and interpretation of the dataset, making it easier to derive actionable insights for decision-making in the data science job market.

The dataset used for this analysis was [Data Science Salaries 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/data-science-salaries-2023/data) available on Kaggle. 

### Tools & Packages used for this analysis:
- Python (3.12.0)
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy (1.26.0)
- Pandas (2.1.1)
- Seaborn (0.13.0)
- Plotly (5.18.0)
- matplotlib (3.8.0)

### The goals & findings of this project was to analyze coutries:
- Explore demographic and job characteristics.
- Examine employment patterns. 
- Geographical Analysis (Employee location vs Company location - ISO3 location code).
- Salary distribution and Trends.
- Remote work analysis.
- Visualize data, user-friendly presentations.

### What I've learned + insights:
- Data Analysis using Python.
- Plotly for visualization with Heatmaps, pie charts, map charts, histograms, etc.
- Geographical data analysis using ISO 3166 country code.
